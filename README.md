# Global-News 
Global news is a site focused on the idea of providing a constant flow of news information on an easy to navigate interface. Using a globe API that operates in javascript, global news will make daily API calls to newspapers with location based coordinates, and configure a 3d rotating globe with news stories as pins in the exact location where the story centralizes. Users can spin the globe to certain areas to check news at different locations, and filter the news by topics such as politics, economics, health etc. Mousing over a pin brings up the headline of the article, and clicking on the pin takes the user to the newspaper's website.
